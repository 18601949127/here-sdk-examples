The hello_map example app shows how the HERE SDK can be integrated into your Flutter project and how you can display a map.

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Set your HERE SDK credentials to
- `hello_map/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- `hello_map/ios/Runner/Info.plist`

2) Open `pubspec.yaml` and adapt the path to the HERE SDK plugin folder.

3) Start an emulator or simulator and execute `flutter run` from the app's directory - or run the app from within your IDE.

More information can be found in the _Get Started_ section of the _Developer's Guide_.
